• A hotel wishes to make its reservations available online. • Following is a list of assumptions about the “Online Reservation Module”. 1. Any (room) booking is “Unconfirmed” until the hotel staff (Cashier/ Receptionist) makes it “Confirmed”. 2. The customer may/ may not log in to make an Unconfirmed booking, but has to provide her personal and contact details to complete the booking. 3. The customer needs to register her user account with the booking system to enable her to log in to the system. 4. The customer's user account is uniquely identified by her user name (uname). 5. A “PIN” is generated for each Confirmed booking. A customer can have many PINs for different bookings. A PIN can never be repeated. 6. Each booking request/ operation in the system must check the following, before an Unconfirmed booking; i) if the requested number of rooms available for the specified booking date, ii) if the requested number of rooms can occupy the specified number of people. Must display the error messages according to errors 7. Each room of the hotel must belong to one Room Type, but a room type may have several rooms listed under that. The main task is to produce a complete Object-Oriented Program done in Java language with the above functionality.  Additional Instructions • You can list any additional assumptions you make for improved readability of your program. • Your program must clearly implement the classes, objects, and their related interactions as appropriate. • You can make any number of Java Classes as you desire, but we suggest you make the Java Classes as follows, 1. BookingRecord – class for booking records with Room Type, Room Number, No of Beds, Price, Status Confirmed/Unconfirmed 2. User – class for users with 2 subclasses for Customers and Staff. Must include Unique Username and Password 3. Room – class for rooms with Room Type, Room Number, No of Beds, Price. • You can have your choice but below has to be the minimum required methods for the JAVA PROJECT, 1. Do a Booking 2. Login Handling (Username, Password) 3. New User Registration • Should include a menu with a good flaw with Command Line Interface (CLI)
